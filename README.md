Little disclaimers what to expect from these scripts and the dataset and how to use them. 

- This repository is associated with the following publication 'Codon usage beyond the frame: Active suppression of TAG as a triplet throughout genomes' (2019) [Link to publication to come]. 

- Python Code (version 3.6) is used throughout this repository.

- Running Analysis.py will create the AnalyzedAll.csv files that are needed to create the plots. 

- All Raw Data files of the datasets are deposited in two file formats: Microsoft Excel Worksheet (.xlsx) & OpenDocument Spreadsheet (.ods). If you want to re - create the figures one has to convert the database into .csv file format.
